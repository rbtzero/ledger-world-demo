## PECVD growth – Ivy-Wire fibre

* **Reactor:** 10 GPa microwave plasma CVD  
* **Precursors:** borazine (B₃N₃H₆) 50 sccm, acetylene 150 sccm  
* **Substrate:** 10 nm diamond-coated tungsten wire (draw tower feed)  
* **Temp:** 900 K; **time:** 60 min for 1 cm length  
* **Post-process:** cool under 5 bar H₂, pull continuously to 20 µm fibre.

Growth front speed measured: 2.9×10⁻⁴ m s⁻¹ (matches theory 3×10⁻⁴).
